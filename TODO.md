* Make page prettier
* Add weather
* Add NPCs with AI based on crime data
* Fix 'river' glitch ~ That, Harry, is a FEATURE!
* Add click->teleport to minimap
* Add minimap zoom options, so the whole of Britain can be shown if neccessary and can be switched to/from the current view
* Possibly add economy; this will mean robbers can rob you of things and there will nearly be a point to the game :)
* Add text showing you what county you are in and possibly it's details; maybe show latitude and longitude of player
