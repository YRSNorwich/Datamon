* Add AI for NPCs
* Fix 'river' glitch / improve star ship enterprise map rip
* Add click->teleport to minimap
* Add minimap zoom options, so the whole of Britain can be shown if neccessary and can be switched to/from the current view
* Possibly add economy; this will mean robbers can rob you of things and there will nearly be a point to the game :)
